A short script for condensing all files in multiple folders sharing a similar key to a single folder. The destination folder should be created beforehand. An example of when this situation may occur is downloading files from Google Drive, where it splits them in to multiple zip files.

Here, I move all files in folders that have the term "Shiki" in it. The files are condensed to a single folder "Shiki". I only cared about video files with the extension .mkv, so I also filtered the files based on that too.
