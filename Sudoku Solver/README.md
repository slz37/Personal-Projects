A user interface for saving, loading, and solving sudoku puzzles. I attempted to use a genetic algorithm first; however, that is too slow and does not properly solve all systems. I'm currently attempting to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">Knuth's Algorithm X</a>, though this is still a work in progress, so the solver is currently non-functional.
