A user interface for saving, loading, and solving sudoku puzzles. Also contains functionality for wiping and randomizing the grid. I first attempted to use a genetic algorithm first; however, that is too slow and does not properly solve all systems. The current solution uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">Knuth's Algorithm X</a>.
